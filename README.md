Coding Dojo Assignment

Assignment: Ninja Gold
Practice passing data to a template
Practice using forms
Practice using Django session
Recreate the Ninja Gold game, but this time with Django.

As a reminder, you're going to create a mini-game that helps a ninja make some money! When you start the game, your ninja should have 0 gold. The ninja can go to different places (farm, cave, house, casino) and earn different amounts of gold. In the case of a casino, your ninja can earn or lose up to 50 gold. Your job is to create a web app that allows this ninja to earn gold and to display past activities of this ninja.

Guidelines
Refer to the wireframe below.
Have the four forms appear when the user goes to http://localhost:8000
Use a hidden input tag in each form to pass the relevant location to the server
Have /process_money determine how much gold the user should have
For now, save the activity log in session
alt text

 Create a new project/app
 Have the root route render the main Ninja Gold page
 Have the "/process_money" POST route increase/decrease the user's gold by an appropriate amount and redirect to the root route
 NINJA BONUS: Refactor your code so the location is being passed in the URL rather than via a form
 SENSEI BONUS: Have the user specify the win conditions before starting, and then implement them in the game (# of moves, goal for gold)
